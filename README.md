# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
This is my second attempt at creating and designing my portfolio, but this time around with bootstrap. I have used all the techniques put in the acceptance criteria but also tried to think outside the box. Creativity is endless when designing. Unfortunately, time isnt. As time goes on, I will continue to add more of my works and skills on here.
It has taken me only a few days to get this far. This is an ongoing project
